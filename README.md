## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   [Go](Go) - I recommend the latest stable release. At least 1.18 is required for generic features.
-   [Git](Git) - I recommend the latest stable release.
-   [GitHub CLI](cli) - you can use git on the command line if you wish, but the github cli is very nice ...

Developed with Go 1.16.4. Updated to Go 1.18. Go is _extremely_ backwards compatible and semver stable. Nearly any v1.x should work fine.
